Source and Data Set

Source Files

The source files used to create tidy data set from the extracted data archive are:

- features_info.txt : Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector
- features.txt      : List of all features
- activity_labels.txt : Links the class labels with their activity name
- train/X_train.txt : Training set
- train/y_train.txt : Training Labels
- test/X_test.txt : Test set
- test/y_test.txt : Test labels

Following file is available for the train and test data:

- train/subject_train.txt : Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each
                            window sample. Range: 1 - 30
                            
Variables

Variables in tidy data set:

Activity:
Activity labels are: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING,
LAYING

SubjectId:

The subjects are represented as a number from 1 to 30

Features:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

Signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '*-[XYZ]$' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

For this dataset, only measurements, which had both mean and std was selected. Reasoning for this was that there was mentioned in instructions that we should extract features which has mean AND std measurements

Features are listed below:

Transformations

Training and testing data set rows were appended and then a unified data set created from the source files
Measurements were extracted from mean and std for each measurement by subject and activity
Variable/column names were labeled with descriptive names
Result was saved as independent tidy data set at ./data/tidy_data.txt
